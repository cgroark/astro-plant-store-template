Like many busy professionals, I noticed a decline in my energy levels after 40, affecting performance in virtually every area of my life.

&nbsp;

I like to take action, so I got certified as a Wellness Coach in 2019 (NBHWC-accredited), an Advanced Breathing Instructor in 2022, and a Sleep, Stress Management, and Recovery Coach in 2025.

&nbsp;

As my my life changes and evolves, I have learned to draw on my coaching knowledge to achieve balance and continue thriving.

&nbsp;

Let me use my experience and training to help you.
